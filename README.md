# Student-Customer-Engagement

## Analysing and Visualising Student Engagement, including key metrics, in a 3 page Dashboard

In this project, I am analysing the student engagament in an educational platform that offeres various tech courses. The project includes SQL queries to extract the data needed to create the visualisation and analysis, as well as key metrics that help identify critical areas of improvement within the educational platform.

### Objective
The questions to be answered in this project are as follows:

- Which courses are the most watched by students and how are they rated
- How many students register each month
- How is the student engagement: minutes watched and average minutes watched based on the different plans provided ( paid and free plan)
- Which countries have the most registered students and does this number scale proportionally to the number of minutes watched per country

1. Retrieving Student Information with SQL
   The [student_info_query](student_info_query.sql) can be found here
2. Retrieving Courses Information with SQL
   The [courses_info_query](course_info_query.sql) can be found here
3. Retrieving Purchasing Information with SQL
   The [purchase_info_query](purchase_info_query.sql) can be found here

### Analysing the Results

[Page 3]([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veronica.mucha/viz/CustomerEngagement-Final/Page1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veronica.mucha/viz/CustomerEngagement-Final/Page1) of the Dashboard shows the Top 5 most watched courses by students. This is rated by total minutes watched, Averagerage minutes, number of ratings and average rating. The Introduction to Data and Data Science course is the most popular/wached course amongst students. This would imply that the Data Science course is what most students are looking to embark on as a career.
